			ViralMeteoriteTip: Did you feel that too? It felt as if a certain force were pulling us toward the meteor. That is no ordinary meteor, we must find it immediately. If that meteorite happened to be a Viral Meteorite, we must take care of that virus as soon as possible before it falls into the wrong hands again. Make sure to check the entire surface of the world for it. If you can't find it, check your sky islands and chasms as well. Hurry!
			Hamon: I haven't heard much about it, but that old man tells me that Hamon is a versatile use of sun-like energy. From what he's told me, it can increase your physical capabilities and be used defensively or offensively, healing being one of its most useful uses. If that's all true, it's no wonder that man has lived this long.
			StarPlatinumT1:
				'''
				You trying to mock me by asking about my own stand? What a pain... Well, I guess I'd be the one to know the most about it. I'll tell you what I can.
				Good grief, you've only just awoken Star Platinum? I expected better of a copycat like yourself. In its first or second tier, Star Platinum is nothing but a glorified pair of floating fists, but things get a bit more interesting as you reach its third and fourth tier.
				'''
			StarPlatinumT2: Now in its second tier, Star Platinum has the ability to use Star Finger, a medium-range attack that you can use to attack from a distance. I've personally rarely used this move, but it can be useful in certain situations.
			StarPlatinumT3: Your Star Platinum just keeps getting stronger and stronger. An alternative to the Star Finger you learned not long ago could be flicking bullets. Star Platinum can launch a bullet with a simple flick at a speed faster than that of a gun. It ended up being a more reliable ability when I used it.
			StarPlatinumFinal: At its fourth tier, Star Platinum awakens its dormant ability, Star Platinum: The World. I learned this on my trip to Egypt in the 80s, but even I don't know why both Star Platinum and The World can stop time, though it sure worked out in my favor either way.
			HierophantGreenT1:
				'''
				Your stand... one of my old friends had it. 'Nobody can deflect the emerald splash' he said. It's up to you to find out if that statement's true or not.
				What Hierophant lacks in power, it makes up for in quantity. Hierophant Green's main ability is to send out a ton of emerald splashes at a time, but unfortunately they do a very little amount of damage.
				'''
			HierophantGreenT2: You now have the ability to shoot wires that wrap and paralyze your enemies. Enemies that are wrapped in your wires will not be able to move for a short time, so use that time wisely. Hierophant Green is also able to be controlled at much farther distances now, so take advantage of that to set up tripwires and shoot from advantageous positions.
			HierophantGreenT3Final: Ah, 20m Emerald Splash. The Old Man told me that my old friend used it during our fight against DIO. It sets up multiple tripwires around the player, covering about 30 tiles but at the cost of not being able to normally use your Hierophant Green.
			TheWorldT1:
				'''
				...Get that thing away from me... Well, I guess I could tell you a bit about it, considering it's the same type of stand as my Star Platinum, but I won't enjoy it.
				In its first tier, I would guess that The World would just be able to punch, like Star Platinum, while getting stronger and faster in its second. Talk to me again when it's a bit stronger.
				'''
			TheWorldT2: Now that your The World got a bit stronger, I would assume that it learned its signature ability Time Stop, although I'm not sure why it doesn't learn it sooner. Use your special key to activate it.
			TheWorldT3: Now that The World is at its third tier, The World can to throw deadly knives. I'm pretty sure those monsters outside aren't smart enough to hide Shonen Jump underneath their clothes, so the knives are pretty effective.
			TheWorldFinal: Now this is The World I remember. You have fully learned The World's extents, and can now stop time for 9 seconds while throwing flurrys of knives at your enemies. You can even throw Road Rollers at your enemies while time is stopped too! Do me a favor and stay away from me.
			KillerQueenT1T2:
				'''
				That stand... I'm sure I destroyed its user... or, at least, that ambulance did. Well, either way, Killer Queen can turn things into bombs. Not physically, but any object, when touched, will make whoever's touching it explode.
				Killer Queen can throw out a barrage of punches, like most stands of its type, but it can also trigger a controlled detonation on a solid... block. This explosion has the power to damage enemies, but not the ground. Also, be careful not to blow yourself up.
				'''
			KillerQueenT3Final: You've unlocked Sheer Heart Attack- it has no weaknesses. It's a small tank-like thing that pursues enemies, and even my Star Platinum wasn't able to destroy it. It's quite a unique ability... In it's fourth tier the cooldown for Sheer Heart Attack decreases and you will be able to send him out more.
			KillerQueenBTD: You've unlocked yet another power... Bites The Dust. Bites the Dust allows you to rewind time back to the moment you first activated the ability. It's useful for dodging lethal events that you know will happen in the future, in theory anyway. We only know this much because of the way its original user acted before his... final moments.
			AchtungBaby: Wha... Frankly, I'm not gonna ask how that's even possible. Perhaps the universal rupture caused the stand's power to transfer into the sunglasses. Either way, that Stand makes you invisible.
			GoldExperienceT1:
				'''
				Ah, that stand... The stand of, what was his name, Haruno... no, Giorno Giovanna. Never got to ask him about it too much. What I do know is that it has an ability with extreme potential- the ability to create life.
				In its current state, Gold Experience can only do so much. For now, you can create a frog that will counterattack anyone who strikes you. A strange way to counter an attack, but it works nonetheless.
				'''
			GoldExperienceT2: Now, Gold Experience has unlocked the ability to create barriers for you. These barriers are actually trees, but they still offer protection from attacks, as if they were walls.
			GoldExperienceT3: Ah, that ability... now you can accelerate the senses of your enemy so fast that they have quite the out of body experience, if you catch my drift. It also slows their physical bodies down. Along with that, you can create butterflies that will protect the loot an enemy is carrying, so that they don't get destroyed while fighting you. If you don't know what I mean, it doubles the chances of enemy loot.
			GoldExperienceFinal: Gold Experience's arguably best ability, Limb Recreation, has been unlocked. With this, you can regenerate your health by healing your wounds. Only one more step...
			GoldExperienceRequiem: So this is what happens when the arrow binds to your Stand. Gold Experience Requiem has been unleashed, and its powers are yours. Its new abilities are the ability to loop an enemy's death multiple times as well as the ability to cancel the actions of enemies that touch you. When that happens, they return to where they came from.
			TuskAct1:
				'''
				The mysterious force of the Spin... it reminds me of Hamon. Anyways, Tusk has Acts similar to the stand Echoes. Each act gains a new ability with the Spin. Every Spin user's goal is to attain the Infinite Spin. Think you can do it, {0}? 
				Tusk was somewhat weak when it began, only being able to fire nails like a bullet from a gun. By the way, I don't mean the metal kind of nails. I mean your fingernails and toenails. Don't worry, they grow back.
				'''
			TuskAct2: Tusk Act 2 has learned the power of the Golden Rectangle, and can now fire nail bullets that can be guided towards targets. You move closer to the Infinite Spin.
			TuskAct3: Act 3 allows you to fire a nail what creates a wormhole, which you can then travel through. This allows you to get the jump on enemies. Make sure you only fire if you have no doubts.
			TuskAct4: Tusk Act 4 has found the power of the Infinite Spin, and can cause enemies to... infinitely spin. Along with that, Act 4 can now manifest into a stronger form than the other three acts, allowing it to punch enemies. The catch is that you have to gain rotational energy using Slow Dancer though... But congratulations on obtaining such a power. I'm sure it was a long and roundabout path.
			StickyFingersT1:
				'''
					While zippers may seem like quite the mundane ability to have, Sticky Fingers is a stand that lets you use them to their absolute maximum potential. Figure out how to use the zippers, and your enemies will be saying Arrivederci, very quickly.
				At first, Sticky Fingers isn't the most powerful of Stands though it does allow you to unzip your enemies as it punches. Keep it going, don't let your resolve waver, and power up further.
				'''
			StickyFingersT2: If you haven't already noticed the versatility of your Stand, you will soon. You can now unzip your own arms to punch targets outside of your Stand Range. On top of that, you can also hide inside of tiles to sneak up on enemies. This is only the beginning for your abilities, keep getting stronger and you'll find many more uses for your zippers.
			StickyFingersT3: Would you look at that, you can place zippers on yourself. Funny how you could use your ability on yourself while others like Josuke can't. In any case, that ability will come in handy if you ever want to dodge an incoming attack. Another thing you might have already noticed is you can zip through the ground at high speeds. That'll sure help you traverse.
			StickyFingersT4: Sticky Fingers sure became a Stand no one would want to mess with. You can attack from far, hide in tiles, unzip yourself to dodge attacks, and even move around through tiles. If a Stand User with that Stand were to have faced off against us back in Egypt, we could've been in some serious trouble.
			SexPistolsT1: Ah, good grief... this, well, these, are Sex Pistols. They're six, sentient, bullet-shaped stands that will stay around the area you want them to. Whenever a bullet goes near them, they will redirect that bullet to the nearest enemy. Sex Pistols never gained any new or extreme abilities, but each of your upgrades increases your guns power. More efficiency means more rounds out, and more bodies.
			SexPistolsT2: The pistols should be able to kick bullets with even greater force now. Did I tell you that the Pistols need to eat?
			SexPistolsT3: Faster and faster the chamber goes, can you keep up long enough to keep firing? Pressing " + JoJoStands.SpecialHotKey.GetAssignedKeys()[0] + " will allow your pistols to go into a frenzy, where they would kick bullets until the end.
			SexPistolsFinal: Sex Pistols has reached max power, they come back to you almost instantly now. Just remember to keep some food in your pockets...
			KingCrimsonT1:
				'''
				The power of King Crimson falls to you now. A powerful stand that strikes at the speed of a sledgehammer. Learn its speeds and take control of its immense power.
					Right now, King Crimson is only capable of striking opponents. This isn't at all a bad thing, because of how King Crimson attacks. King Crimson strikes with such ferocity that it has been shown to tear holes opponents in people, and the attacks have such force that you will fly forward when attacks come out.
				'''
			KingCrimsonT2: King Crimson has acquired its signature ability of skipping time. It's a strange ability in concept, so here's a summary- you can remove the cause from the effect. Jump past time itself, confuse your enemies, and take your place at the apex of creation. And now that it can use its signurature ability, it can also perform 'Quick Timeskips' when needed, mainly while it's blocking enemies.
			KingCrimsonT3Final: Congrats, it seems you've unlocked the power of Epitaph. Epitaph is able to look into the future, so you can anticipate your enemies moves and prepare for them in advance.
			CenturyBoyT1: This Stand has no weaknesses, defensively. Century Boy is the ultimate physical defense- when you activate it, the stand mounts itself on your body and you are impervious to all harm. This does have one minor weakness... you lose the ability to move. Do with that what you will.
			CenturyBoyT2: Looks like you learned that starting a dynamite then going invincible hurts your enemies and not you. What was stopping you from doing this earlier?
			DollyDaggerT1: Intel from the SPW suggests that this stand merely reflects 35% of damage taken. Hm. We're lucky to have never faced against this Stand.
			DollyDaggerT2: Now that you've honed your Dolly Dagger, it can relflect about 70% of damage taken. Even I would have trouble fighting you with that amount of reflection. Oh, you can also stab yourself with the dagger to send that damage to the nearest enemy. That stand of yours has lots of potential.
			MagiciansRedT1: Ah, Magician's Red. The original owner of this Stand was the man who taught me about Stands in the first place. You can manipulate fire and create Ankhs to burn your enemies to ash.
			MagiciansRedT2: Magician's Red can now use Red Bind, a technique to restrain enemies with your fire. Don't ask me how that doesn't burn through them.
			MagiciansRedT3Final: Now, Magician's Red has relearned all of its abilities. With Crossfire Hurricane, you can launch a volley of Ankhs and overwhelm your enemies.
			AerosmithT1: Aerosmith may appear to be nothing more than a model plane, but don't be fooled. It has potential to be extremely powerful and agile. Let loose a hellstorm of bullets and turn your foes into a pincushion.
			AerosmithT2: Now, Aerosmith can drop bombs on your enemies. Light them up brighter than before!
			AerosmithT3Final: With this, Aerosmith can now find enemies using a CO2 detecting radar. If it breathes, make sure it won't anymore.
			TheHandT1: Right now, The Hand is weak, only able to punch your opponents. It may be a good punch, but there's not much else right now.
			TheHandT2: The Hand can now use its signature ability... its right hand. You can use The Hand's hand to scrape away space itself and teleport short distances. The Hand can now cause enemies to, perhaps, lose a few organs.
			TheHandT3: With your increased mastery of The Hand, you can now pull enemies towards you by tapping " + JoJoStands.SpecialHotKey.GetAssignedKeys()[0] + ", and you can perform a very powerful attack with The Hand's Hand by holding" + JoJoStands.SpecialHotKey.GetAssignedKeys()[0] + ", given that they are in range.
			TheHandFinal: The Hand has reached its maximum potential, and is more powerful than ever. Of course, you seem to be smarter than its previous user. I'm not saying he was a bad kid, or anything. Wonder where he is now...
			GratefulDeadT1:
				'''
				Just seeing that Stand is making me feel older than I already am. That's the ability of Grateful Dead, so be careful using it around people you wanna keep around.
				Right now, Grateful Dead can only punch things. Not exactly unusual. Just keep going.
				'''
			GratefulDeadT2: Now, Grateful Dead can grab a target and forcefully age them. The amount of time aged depends on how long you hold them. Don't do handshakes.
			GratefulDeadT3: So, this Stand just became even more of a safety hazard to any allies, because now it can spread the aging effect as a mist. It's not as immediate, but now multiple people can be aged forwards at once.
			GratefulDeadFinal: Finally, Grateful Dead is at maximum power. Just... stay a few feet away from me. I already have a couple of gray hairs.
			LockT1T2: Oh. The Lock. I feel bad that you have to use this one... wait a minute. The Lock has the ability to make others' hearts heavy with guilt, literally. Use it, and anything that harms you will start to feel that immense weight. Some things may be immune to that guilt, and it can be overcome.
			LockT3Final: The Lock can now force others to feel guilty without any action against you... by harming yourself. Use this ability with caution.
			WhitesnakeT1:
				'''
				Okay, you need to step away before I crush you. Get that Stand out of my sight. If you think I'm joking, come and find out.
				*sigh* Well, fine. Whitesnake, at this stage, can only throw punches. That's it.
				'''
			WhitesnakeT2: Now, Whitesnake can secrete a gooey substance that damages enemies and sticks to surfaces. It's not a pleasant experience for those affected. You'll also notice that you can send Whitesnake farther away from you now, and that it has a gun. As you get stronger, that ability will help you out more and more, keep that in mind.
			WhitesnakeT3: Whitesnake has unlocked the ability to steal discs from opponents. If your enemy isn't a Stand user, then they'll be devoid of thought for a few moments. If they are, then you'll disable their Stand temporarily- do all of this by pressing and holding " + JoJoStands.SpecialHotKey.GetAssignedKeys()[0]
			WhitesnakeFinal: Due to your annoying persistence, Whitesnake has reached its maximum potential. Now, keep it away from me, I mean it.
			SilverChariotT1:
				'''
				Ah, Silver Chariot. Another Stand that belonged to a friend of mine, a fellow Stardust Crusader. You think my hair is ridiculous, you should have seen his. Anyways, Silver Chariot wields a rapier with lightning speed and deadly precision.
				At the moment, Silver Chariot can only stab with its rapier. However underwhelming that may sound, the stabs come out extremely quick, almost invisible to the eye.
				'''
			SilverChariotT2: On top of your stabbing flurry, Silver Chariot can now deflect projectiles back at your enemy with it's rapier, almost as if it's playing a game of baseball, or tennis.
			SilverChariotT3: At this stage, Silver Chariot can now shed its armor to become so fast it can create afterimages. What this does for you is allows Silver Chariot to move significantly faster, but you also take more damage. Use this carefully.
			SilverChariotFinal: Silver Chariot has reached the highest peak it can. The power of this stand alone rivals legendary swordsmen of old, and your toughest enemies. I wonder what would happen if this Stand were to change form or something.
			CreamT1:
				'''
				That Stand makes me... nervous, and I cannot tell you why. Anyways, uh, Cream can harness the void and erase things, almost like that blockhead friend of Josuke's.
				Just like the rest, Cream cannot do very much at this stage. It can throw a mean chop though, and it can cause enemies to lose their organs. Literally. It can also dash toward enemies in its Void form.
				'''
			CreamT2: Cream has gained the ability to, well, eat you. Specifically, you can enter the void by pressing " + JoJoStands.SpecialHotKey.GetAssignedKeys()[0] + " and riding in Cream like an interdimensional ball of sorts. To control Cream in this state, use your 'left-click' to guide it. The downsides are that you have a limited time in there, indicated by the Void Gauge, and you are effectively blind while in the void, so know where your target is beforehand. Once that time runs out, Cream pukes you out. I am being serious.
			CreamT3: As a way to quickly refill your Void Gauge, Cream can consume you and fly about. On top of that, your void offensive now lasts longer, and once it runs out, Cream automatically enters that defensive recharge state instead of being puked out.
			CreamFinal: At this final point, Cream can stay in the void for even longer. Once it runs out, you will still enter the recharge state rather than being puked out. Actually, I wonder if you could use this to fire yourself like a cannon... questions for another day.
			HermitPurpleT1:
				'''
				Never in my life did I think I would see another Stand user with Hermit Purple. That Stand is special because the last owner I knew, my gramps, was a Hamon user as well, which makes it unique in that he used both in tandem. I wonder, do you have that ability?
				At the moment, Hermit Purple is nothing more than a mass of vines. You can certainly hit people with them. It will certainly be more effective than getting mauled.
				'''
			HermitPurpleT2: Well, it seems my initial question has been answered. Hermit Purple coils around you, and anything that opts to attack you will be met with quite the burn. On top of that, now you can grab and pull enemies into their eventual doom by 'clicking and holding right-click'.
			HermitPurpleT3: Your connection to Hermit Purple grows like rampant vines You can now press " + JoJoStands.SpecialHotKey.GetAssignedKeys()[0] + " to overcharge Hermit Purple with Hamon and power up your passive counter. The next three things that hit you will not only feel the burn, but they will take damage and get knocked away.
			HermitPurpleFinal: Hermit Purple is as strong as it will ever be, thanks to you. I know that the old man would never have come close, as long as he lived. I still have no idea how he managed to survive as long as he did.
			BadCompanyT1:
				'''
				That Stand... I've never seen it before, though I do remember some descriptions of a Stand like this from Josuke a while back.
				According to Josuke, that Stand was able to summon armies of soldiers, tanks, and attack helicopters, though I'd imagine that at this stage, soldiers would be all you could handle. I'll have to ask Josuke for greater details on this Stand.
				'''
			BadCompanyT2: Your Stand, Bad Company, should now be able to summon more troops, as well as summon tanks. Your troops should also be much stronger now that they've gained combat experience.
			BadCompanyT3: According to Josuke, by now, you should be able to summon attack helicopters. Those helicopters would be your greatest asset, but don't depend on them too much. This is just a guess but, if you can summon attack helicopters, what's stopping you from summoning war planes?
			BadCompanyFinal: This Stand is surely something to be afraid of. You now have a small militia under your command, with soldiers, tanks, attack helicopters, and war planes under your command. It amazes me that Josuke was able to survive that battle.
			StoneFreeT1:
				'''
				That's... my daughter's stand. Its power allows you to turn it into string. While that may sound very mundane or useless, trust me when I say that it is no joke.
				At this point, Stone Free has not gained the ability to do much besides punching, but it's quite the punch, if I do say so myself.
				'''
			StoneFreeT2: Stone Free has started to tap into its unraveling abilities. This one, specifically, allows you to weave a trap between two tiles for any unsuspecting foes. It may not seem like much now, but when used properly it can be an incredibly deadly weapon.
			StoneFreeT3: Your strings have strengthened considerably. Now, you can use Stone Free's threads to bind enemies, stopping them in their tracks. Who knows, you may be able to bind them and drag them to you as well.
			StoneFreeFinal: This final power-up from Stone Free allows you to weave Stone Free's thread into a strong shield to protect yourself from harm. Now, go forth and spin a legendary tale with this power!
			SoftAndWetT1:
				'''
				Did you let a bubble loose in here? Be careful not to let it pop near me. Those bubbles are capable of taking something from whatever they pop next to, and I'd prefer to keep my eyesight.
				On top of that, the bubbles can apply those stolen properties to anything they pop close to. Have you tried holding a torch out and shooting a bubble? I wonder what would happen if those sorts of bubbles popped.
				'''
			SoftAndWetT2: Hmm. Seems these bubbles are more durable than I thought. With your ability, I'm sure you can create larger, defensive bubbles now. You should be able to coat yourself in one, giving you some welcome protection.
			SoftAndWetT3: Soft & Wet can now create bubbles while in the heat of battle. They seem to do a great deal of damage on impact, making you quite the threat. Your bubbles are getting more and more powerful, I wonder if there's a certain force behind their abilities?
			SoftAndWetFinal: This power! It can't be. It seems the bubbles can now be used to plant bombs in the ground. This kind of power seems unsettlingly familiar. We'll chalk this up to coincidence. For now.
			SoftAndWetGoBeyond:
				'''
				Good grief, you really did go beyond your normal capabilities. I've seen this type of explosive power before, back in Morioh, but it's changed. Evolved. It 'goes beyond' nature.
				Your bubbles are not 'just' bubbles. They're actually a thin line spinning at incredible speeds. If this line reaches a vanishing point, there's no telling what your bubbles can achieve. They could transcend logic, itself. How terrifying... Not only that, you can control when they explode, which would be useful for you and deadly for the target.
				'''
			VirtualInsanityT1:
				'''
				Good grief, that seems to be a Stand more versatile than most. The energy it radiates seems... different, to say the least.
				From what I can gather, your Stand seems to be a close-combat type but can fight at a range- at the cost of less destructive power. Beginning with its fists for close combat, that sword on its hip should allow it to reach farther while making up for some of the power loss, and the ability to transform one of its arms into a literal hand cannon fills the range gap for far away enemies.
				'''
			VirtualInsanityT2:
				'''
				Your stand seems much more proficient with its weapons now. Congrats. With a Stand as versatile as that one I'm sure there's many more ways to utilize those weapons.
				On top of that, it also appears to have a much more sporadic aura to it, as if there were pent-up energy waiting to be released...
				'''
			VirtualInsanityT3:
				'''
				Fascinating. The stronger this stand gets, the more unfamiliar the energy it exudes becomes. Well, no matter the case, your stand has definitely grown in strength.
				Due to that, you seem to have reached the full potential for each of your weapons. That pent up energy seems to push those weapons to their absolute limit. I suppose its a good thing the reserve of energy your stand can tap into has been increased. Perhaps you can do more while in that state...
				'''
			VirtualInsanityFinal:
				'''
				It seems your stand's power has reached its peak. The energy stored within has become much easier to control, reducing its strain on your and your Stand. I was curious to see how strong this Stand could have become, yet your growth surpassed my expectations.
				Good grief... the destruction this Stand could cause if it were in the hands of someone like DIO. Notify me of any further developments in ability.
				'''
			CrazyDiamondT1: Is that- so it is... That is Crazy Diamond, the stand of a kid with a good heart, and a strange do... Just do not tell him I said that. Like many Stands, Crazy Diamond packs quite the punch, but do not let that fool you. Beneath its tough exterior, it harbors a kind ability. You can restore anything you touch, heal wounds, and even revert things into their original parts. Stands like these have the power to do a lot of good.
			CrazyDiamondT2: This brings back memories. You should now be able to flick bullets using Crazy Diamond's immense power. It may not be a real ability, but you should be able to break through just about anything with a nice bullet. As for your restoration ability, remember you can restore anything of value. Keep in mind however that this Stand isn't capable of bringing things back from the dead.
			CrazyDiamondT3: Good grief... It looks like the angry ticks of that punk are simply rooted into Crazy Diamond. To be safe, I'll refrain from mentioning anything about your hair. You are now capable of breaking into an uncontrollable rage, allowing Crazy Diamond to enter a state of anger and empowerment at the cost of speed. Using restoration mode in such a state is bound to be a mess. In other news, your restoration should be a lot more potent now, capable of bringing back anyone from the brink of defeat.
			CrazyDiamondFinal: Well, it looks like you've gotten the hang of Crazy Diamond. It has gotten much stronger too. You and your Stand sure do remind me of my time in Morioh. All I ask is that you use this ability to protect those who need it, and punish those who threaten them. A golden heart is needed to use Crazy Diamond to its fullest potential. I'm sure you have what it takes.
			TowerOfGrayT1: Ugh... I thought I would never have to see that nasty bug again. This is one of the first Stands we encountered on our way to Egypt. You will have to forgive my disgust. Anyway, Tower of Gray is capable of traveling far distances, all while attacking with its piercing tongue. Do with that what you will.
			TowerOfGrayT2: The bug has gotten stronger... good grief. It can now move at crazy speeds, even my Star Platinum has trouble keeping up with it. Tower of Gray should now be able to tear through enemies like a bullet. Its useful, if not a bit gruesome.
			TowerOfGrayT3: The old man who possessed that Stand had some sick tendencies. He enjoyed taking the tongues out of his victims, using the insane precision for dastardly pleasures. I still shudder at the thought of that night. Anyway, Tower of Gray is capable of tearing out the tongues of a whole lot of people at once, like an unfortunate shish-kabob... Just do not get any ideas, okay?
			TowerOfGrayFinal: It seems you have reached your Stand's highest potential. It's piercing tongue is a weapon one would be a fool to ignore. Now, if that is all, I will be on my way. I would like to keep my distance from that thing.
			EchoesAct0: Hmmm? Is that an egg? Wait, I have seen this before... Could it be? Yes, this is Echoes! Or, at least, it will be. If you are looking to get more out of this Stand, you are going to have to grow alongside it. You will need a Strong Will to evolve, and a whole lot of bravery to bring an egg into battle.
			EchoesAct1: I'm surprised you've made it this far. It seems I underestimated your willpower. This is Echoes Act 1. While it may be weak, Echoes' ability is where it's true strength lies. You should be able to generate sound effects on those you touch. This can either debilitate an enemy, or reassure a friend. Whatever you do, just be sure to make some noise. If you are looking to grow your abilities further, I would recommend taking Act 1 into a dangerous fight. Maybe try those creepy mechanical eyes I have seen floating around.
			EchoesAct2: You survived. Good. Now things are getting interesting. Echoes Act 2 is able to take those sounds effects of yours and make them do some real damage. Using the tip of it is tail, you will be able to place these sound effects wherever you want. You should be able to take better control of the battlefield. However, if you are looking to push your capabilities even further, you will need to face your greatest challenge yet. Others are telling me about this bizarre temple underneath the jungle. Try checking that out.
			EchoesAct3: You have grown. This is Echoes Act 3, it's final form! You'll find that this form heavily exchanges range for power. You should now have the ability to use Three Freeze! This makes a single target extremely heavy, keeping them in place. It is a reliable ability. Your hard work has paid off. If the time ever comes, I hope I can rely on you.
